  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    This is a computer programming system that was created by DonaldConnus (WEB). It is designed to apply my proposed literary programming in practice. Normally, when you write a program, you first write the program and later use the annotation to describe the program's behavior. In literary programming, a program is written in words about how it should work, and codes related to the movement are written by special symbols. Then, using the Web, the parts associated with the description are extracted into printable documents and the source code parts are extracted from compilable codes.
