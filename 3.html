  <h2>javaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (English : JavaScript) is an object-based scripting language. This language is commonly used within Web browsers and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used in server programming, such as the runtime environment of Node.js. The JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later LiveScript, which became JavaScript. Although the syntax of JavaScript is similar to that of Javain Micro Systems, it is in fact based on the basic syntax of both languages, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Other than its name and phrase, it is more similar to Self-Nasskim than Java.
